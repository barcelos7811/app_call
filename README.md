# app_call

Hello my name is ricardo barcelos i am brazilian and currently i live in Fortaleza capital cear√°, i will present a simple web project
the project was developed in python language,
I used flask to build front end and back end,
and for database connection I used sqlalchemy.

In this simple project I show a tool that can be used by IT technicians to control tickets related to various software and hardware problems, registered by the user.

The project was divided into api_call and app_call, for api_call I control objects and for app_call I control routes and pages.

I basically created two routines, one to register calls and the other to register users.

by default, I CRUDed each one of them.
In the routine of calls, the problems that must be registered by the user, throughout the working day.
An IT team is monitoring these tickets.

For user registration, the system will only keep the login, user and password, necessary to enter the application.

Thank you very much for the opportunity, to the teachers a big hug. see you later.
